IDEA

An app that allows people to make a schedule for the day and click a button to begin it when they choose
The use case is for people who like to wake up without alarm clocks
Example: 

- I know I'd like to work for 6 hours tomorrow and go to the gym
- I would like to break my work into blocks of 1.5 hrs with 30 min breaks in between
- I'd like to go the gym around 3 pm. 
- I press the "push schedule" button and my tasks are automatically populated on a schedule 

* the schedule will have an interface similar to Apple's daily calendar view
* there will be a page that shows the calendar (1)
* there will be a page that allows users to enter (0):
    - Task 1
    - task name
    - task duration (read in terms of minutes)
    - how long will your break after this task be?


    -Task 2, etc., etc., etc. 

    Up to 10 

* there will be a "start now" button 
    - this button will read the user's current time and populate the calendar with their tasks based on the moment they entered
